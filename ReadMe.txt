Helicopter style game starring my girlfriends guinea pigs Lily and Luna. Plan is to eventually deploy to andoid and iphone devices. This project was a small one to get my feet wet with html game dev. and the phaser.io framework. Hopefully with further development on this game I can begin more ambitious and inventive projects.
